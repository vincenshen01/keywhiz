When submitting code, please make efforts to follow existing conventions and
style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make
sure your code compiles and passes tests by running `mvn clean verify`.

Before your code can be accepted into the project you must also sign the
Individual Contributor License Agreement. We use [cla-assistant.io][1] and you
will be prompted to sign once a pull request is opened.
